In the first step preprocessor takes the
code and removes comments, replace all
defines and add header files for all included
libraries.
After that the compiler converts the code
into assembly. 
In the next step assembly code is converted
into object code.
In the last step linker combine all object 
files and resolve all unknown addresses.
The result is executable file.

The difference between static and dynamic 
library is that in the static library
all of the machine code is in the exe. 
While in dynamic libraries starts their 
work in run time of the program. The 
advantages of dynamic library is that it 
is load one time for all programs and it is
easy to change. Their is no need to precompile
all applications whixh contains this library.
The disadvantages are that it needs a loader
for the dynamic library and so operating 
system. But saves memory.
